"""Bridge between kitchen coursing and floor-plan table pacing.

Two systems in this codebase are called "course" and mean different things:

  * `table_courses` — front-of-house pacing (seated -> drinks -> entree ->
    main -> dessert -> coffee -> check) with dwell timers and overdue colours
    on the floor plan.
  * kitchen coursing — which dish fires when, per ticket.

They ran independently, so the floor plan could show a table on "drinks"
twenty minutes after the kitchen fired its mains. Firing a kitchen course now
advances the table's pacing state to match, which means the dwell timers
measure something real.

This is best-effort on purpose: pacing is a display aid, and a failure to
advance it must never stop a course reaching the pass.
