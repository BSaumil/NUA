1. Press **Windows Key + R**
2. Type: `cmd`
3. Press Enter
4. Navigate to folder:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\NUAPOS
   ```

### PART 3: Verify Download

#### Step 9: Run Verification Script

**In Command Prompt (opened in project folder):**

```bash
python check_prerequisites.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
=============================================================

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't find Download button on platform
**Solutions:**
1. Check platform documentation
2. Look in File menu
3. Look in Settings/Options
4. Try right-clicking on project name
5. Ask platform support: "How do I download my workspace?"
6. Alternative: Use GitHub method (see GITHUB_DOWNLOAD_GUIDE.md)

---

### Issue: Downloaded file is corrupt or won't extract
**Solutions:**
1. Delete downloaded ZIP
2. Clear browser cache
3. Download again
4. Try different browser
5. Check internet connection
6. Disable antivirus temporarily during download

---

### Issue: Extraction fails with error
**Solutions:**
1. Try extracting to Desktop first (fewer permission issues)
2. Run File Explorer as Administrator:
   - Search "File Explorer"
   - Right-click → "Run as administrator"
3. Check available disk space (need 5+ GB)
4. Use different extraction tool (7-Zip, WinRAR)

---

### Issue: Files missing after extraction
**Solutions:**
1. Re-extract (don't drag individual files)
2. Use "Extract All" instead of drag-drop
3. Check if antivirus quarantined files
4. Download ZIP again (might be incomplete)

---

### Issue: Command Prompt won't open in folder
**Solutions:**
1. Open Command Prompt normally
2. Navigate manually:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Path\To\Your\NUAPOS\Folder
   ```
3. Or use PowerShell instead (works the same)

---

### Issue: `python check_prerequisites.py` gives error
**Solutions:**

**If "python is not recognized":**
- Python not installed yet (that's OK!)
- We'll install it in WINDOWS_SETUP_GUIDE.md
- Skip this step for now

**If "No such file":**
- You're in wrong folder
- Run: `dir` to see current files
- Navigate to correct folder: `cd path\to\nuapos`

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Organize Your Files
Create a dedicated folder structure:
```
C:\Projects\        (Main projects folder)
  ├── NUAPOS\   (This project)
  └── OtherProjects\
```

### Keep Original ZIP
Don't delete the downloaded ZIP file until you successfully build the .exe. You might need to re-extract.

### Backup
After successful build, copy the entire folder to an external drive or cloud storage.

### Path Length
Keep the extraction path short to avoid Windows path length limits:
- ✅ Good: `C:\Projects\NUAPOS\`
- ❌ Bad: `C:\Users\...\Very\Long\Path\With\Many\Folders\...\NUAPOS\`

## 🔄 Re-downloading Updates

If you make changes in the platform:

1. Download new ZIP from platform
2. **Backup your current folder** (rename to `NUAPOS-old`)
3. Extract new ZIP to same location
4. If you made local changes, manually copy them over

**Better approach:** Use GitHub method for easier updates!
