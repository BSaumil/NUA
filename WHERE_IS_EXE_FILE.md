## 💡 Best Approach (Recommended)

### Hybrid Solution:

1. **Use Web Version Now** (Immediate)
   - Already running and working
   - Access at `http://localhost:3000`
   - Create desktop shortcut

2. **Deploy to Cloud** (For anywhere access)
   - Click "Deploy" in chat
   - Get URL: `https://ananta-pos.emergent.sh`
   - Access from any device

## 🎯 Why No Pre-Built .exe?

**Technical Reasons:**

1. **Size:** ~300MB file - too large for chat/email
2. **Security:** Windows blocks unsigned .exe files
3. **Customization:** Each business needs different config
4. **Updates:** Source code easier to update than binary
5. **Platform:** Need Windows machine to build Windows app

**Industry Standard:**
- Most software (even commercial) ships as source code
- GitHub releases provide source + build instructions
- Professional builds require code signing ($300-500/year)
