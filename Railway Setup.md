# Nua on Railway — The 5-Year-Old Deployment Guide

Railway is like having a **friendly helper who reads your code and figures everything out**. You just point Railway at your GitHub repo, click some buttons, and ~10 minutes later your app is live. No Linux commands needed.

> **Why Railway vs Fly.io?**
> • Railway: **easiest** — point-and-click UI, auto-detects Node/Python, includes a database.
> • Fly.io: **more control + cheaper at scale**, but you write `fly.toml` and use a CLI.
>
> If you've never deployed anything before → use Railway.
> If you're comfy with a terminal and want to save money long-term → use Fly.io (see `/app/Fly.io Setup.md`).

## 🧰 Step 0 — Get your accounts ready (5 minutes)

| Sign up | Why |
|---|---|
| https://railway.com | Hosts the app |
| https://github.com | Holds the code (use Emergent's "Save to GitHub" button) |

That's it. No CLI install. No Docker. No Linux. Just a browser.

---

## 📦 Step 1 — Save your code to GitHub

In the Emergent chat input box, click the **"Save to GitHub"** option.
Follow the prompts → you'll end up with a repo like `github.com/yourname/nua`.

> Railway reads code from GitHub. So this MUST happen first.

---

## 🚀 Step 2 — Spin up the project on Railway

1. Go to https://railway.com and click **+ New Project**.
2. Choose **Deploy from GitHub repo**.
3. Pick your `nua` repo.
4. Railway will say "What do you want to deploy?" — for now click **Empty Project** so we can add services one at a time.

---

## 📦 Step 3 — Add MongoDB (1 click)

Inside your new Railway project:

1. Click **+ Create → Database → Add MongoDB**.
2. Railway provisions a MongoDB instance in ~30 seconds.
3. Click the new Mongo box → **Variables** tab → copy the value of `MONGO_URL` (looks like `mongodb://mongo:password@containers-us-west-X.railway.app:7654`).

Keep that string ready — we'll paste it into the backend in Step 4.

---

## 🧠 Step 4 — Add the Backend service

1. In the same project, click **+ Create → GitHub Repo** → pick your repo again.
2. After it loads, click the new service → **Settings**:
   - **Root Directory**: `backend` ← **this one is not optional.** See the box below.
   - **Build Command**: *leave blank*
   - **Start Command**: *leave blank*

   > ### ⛔ The #1 cause of a failed first deploy
   > This repo is a **monorepo** — `backend/`, `frontend/` and `bookings-api/`
   > all live side by side, and the repo root holds a `package.json` that
   > exists only for the Capacitor Android build (it has no `scripts`).
   >
   > If **Root Directory** is blank, Railway builds the *repo root*, sees that
   > scriptless `package.json`, and fails the build with:
   >
   > ```
   > No start command detected. Specify a start command
   > ```
   >
   > Setting Root Directory to `backend` points Railway at `backend/Dockerfile`
   > and `backend/railway.json`, which already declare the builder, the start
   > command and the healthcheck. That's also why Build/Start Command stay
   > blank — anything typed into those boxes **overrides** `railway.json`.

3. Click the **Variables** tab → **+ New Variable**. Add these one by one:

| Variable name | Value |
|---|---|
| `MONGO_URL` | *(paste the value from Step 3)* |
| `DB_NAME` | `nua_restaurant` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | *click "Generate" — Railway makes a random one* |
| `EMERGENT_LLM_KEY` | *paste your key from Emergent → Profile → Universal Key* |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | `https://nua-frontend.up.railway.app` *(we'll fix this in Step 6)* |

> **Don't set `PORT` yourself.** Railway assigns it, and the container reads
> `$PORT` at boot (falling back to 8001 for Fly/Compose). Pinning it by hand is
> the usual cause of *"Application failed to respond"* — the app ends up
> listening on one port while Railway routes to another.

4. **Networking** tab → click **Generate Domain**. Railway gives you something like `nua-backend-production.up.railway.app`. **Copy this URL.**

5. Wait ~3 minutes for the first deploy. Open `https://YOUR-BACKEND.up.railway.app/api/` in your browser — you'll get a JSON blob with `"name": "NUA API"`. That's the same path Railway's healthcheck hits, so if the deploy went green, this works.

---

## 🎨 Step 5 — Add the Frontend service

1. **+ Create → GitHub Repo** → same repo again.
2. New service → **Settings**:
   - **Root Directory**: `frontend` ← same rule as the backend. Blank = the
     "No start command detected" build failure.
   - **Build Command**: *leave blank*
   - **Start Command**: *leave blank*

   `frontend/Dockerfile` builds the React bundle and serves it with nginx, and
   `frontend/railway.json` tells Railway to use that Dockerfile. Nothing to type.

3. **Variables** tab — add:

| Variable name | Value |
|---|---|
| `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` | `https://YOUR-BACKEND.up.railway.app` *(from Step 4)* |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` |

> ⚠️ **Most common mistake**: `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` is baked into the JS bundle
> at **build** time (that's how Create React App works), so it MUST be set BEFORE
> the first build. If you set it afterwards, click **Deployments → Redeploy** —
> a restart alone won't pick it up.

> **Don't set `PORT` here either.** nginx renders its listen port from `$PORT`
> when the container starts.

4. **Networking** tab → **Generate Domain**. Note the URL (e.g. `nua-frontend-production.up.railway.app`).

5. Wait ~5 minutes. Open the frontend URL in your browser. 🎉
   Log in with `owner@nua.com` / `NuaOwner2026!`.

---

## 🔁 Step 6 — Sync the backend's `FRONTEND_URL`

Go back to the **Backend service → Variables** and change `FRONTEND_URL` to the real frontend URL from Step 5. Railway auto-redeploys. ~1 minute.

---

## 🌐 Step 7 — Add your own domain (optional)

If you bought `nua-eatery.com`:

### On Railway:
1. Frontend service → **Settings → Networking → Custom Domain** → type `nua-eatery.com` → click **Add Domain**.
2. Railway shows you a **CNAME** value (e.g. `nua-frontend-production.up.railway.app`).

### On your domain registrar (GoDaddy / Namecheap / Cloudflare):
- Add a CNAME record: `www` → `nua-frontend-production.up.railway.app`
- Add an A record for the root using Railway's IP, OR
- If your registrar supports CNAME flattening (Cloudflare does), point `@` → same target.

Wait 5–30 minutes. Railway auto-issues a free HTTPS certificate. 🔒

Then update `FRONTEND_URL` in the backend service again to your custom domain.

---

## 👥 Step 8 — Add the Crew (staff) and Pulse (owner) apps (optional)

Nua ships two extra front doors to the *same* frontend build: **NUA Crew** (a
narrow, mobile-first app for clock-in/roster/time-off) and **NUA Pulse**
(an AI-forward owner dashboard). Neither is a separate deploy — they're
routes (`/staff-app`, `/owner-dashboard`) in the app you already built in
Step 5, switched on by which hostname loaded the page
(`frontend/src/lib/appShell.js`). So this step is *only* two more custom
domains on the **same frontend service**, plus one backend variable update.

### On Railway:
1. **Frontend service → Settings → Networking → Custom Domain** → add
   `staff.nua-eatery.com` → **Add Domain**. Repeat for `owner.nua-eatery.com`.
   (Same service both times — you're adding domains #2 and #3 to the
   frontend you already have, not creating new services.)
2. Railway shows a CNAME for each — same target as your main domain's CNAME.

### On your domain registrar:
- Add a CNAME record: `staff` → *(the CNAME target Railway gave you)*
- Add a CNAME record: `owner` → *(same)*

Wait 5–30 minutes for certs, same as Step 7.

### Back on Railway — the one variable that actually makes it work:
**Backend service → Variables → `FRONTEND_URL`** — this has to list *all
three* origins, comma-separated, or the browser's CORS check silently
blocks `staff.`/`owner.` even once DNS resolves fine:

```
https://nua-eatery.com,https://staff.nua-eatery.com,https://owner.nua-eatery.com
```

Save → Railway auto-redeploys the backend (~1 minute).

### Verify:
Open `staff.nua-eatery.com` and `owner.nua-eatery.com` — each should log in
and show real data (Crew / Pulse respectively), not just the shell with
blank tiles. Blank/failing data after DNS resolves means `FRONTEND_URL`
above is missing an origin or has a typo (no trailing slash, exact scheme).

---

## 🔌 Step 9 — Add the Bookings Partner API (optional)

`bookings-api/` is a **separate** service from the restaurant backend — it's the
multi-tenant booking platform that outside partners call with their own API
keys. You only need it if you're selling bookings-as-a-service. The POS runs
fine without it.

1. **+ Create → GitHub Repo** → same repo.
2. **Settings → Root Directory**: `bookings-api`. Build and Start Command blank
   (`bookings-api/railway.json` + its Dockerfile handle both).
3. **Variables**:

| Variable name | Value |
|---|---|
| `BOOKINGS_MONGO_URL` | *(the same `MONGO_URL` from Step 3 — it uses its own database inside that instance)* |
| `BOOKINGS_DB_NAME` | `nua_bookings` |
| `BOOKINGS_ADMIN_KEY` | *click "Generate" — this key mints partner API keys, so treat it like a root password* |

4. **Networking → Generate Domain**, then check `https://YOUR-BOOKINGS.up.railway.app/health`.

---

## 💸 Cost breakdown

| What | Free tier | Real cost |
|---|---|---|
| Railway (Hobby plan) | $5/month free credit | ~$8–15/month for a small restaurant |
| MongoDB add-on | Included in usage | counted in the $5 |
| Domain | not included | ~$12/year |

**Trial mode**: First $5 of usage is free every month. You'll burn through it in ~3 weeks of always-on usage, then it's pay-as-you-go.

---

## 🔁 Day-2 — How to update later

Every time you make a code change:

1. In Emergent chat → click **"Save to GitHub"**
2. Railway sees the git push and **auto-redeploys** within 2 minutes. No clicks needed.

That's the whole secret sauce — git push = live in production.

---

## 🩹 Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| **Build fails: `No start command detected. Specify a start command`** | **Root Directory is blank**, so Railway is building the repo root instead of a service. Settings → **Root Directory** → set `backend`, `frontend` or `bookings-api` → Redeploy. See the box in Step 4. |
| Build fails: `Nixpacks was unable to generate a build plan` | Same root cause as the row above — Root Directory not set. |
| Build fails somewhere in `pip install emergentintegrations` | Shouldn't happen any more: that package comes from a private index and the Dockerfile now treats it as optional, since every place the code imports it falls back gracefully. If you pasted the old Build Command into Settings, clear it. |
| Build fails with "command not found: yarn" | Clear the **Build Command** box. The frontend builds from `frontend/Dockerfile`, which brings its own Node and yarn. |
| Frontend loads but every API call is `net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` | `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` wasn't set at build time. Set it, then **Deployments → Redeploy**. |
| Backend returns 502 | Check **Deployments → View Logs**. Usually a missing variable. |
| MongoDB connection refused | Make sure `MONGO_URL` was copied from the Mongo service's **Variables** tab, not a placeholder. |
| App keeps "sleeping" | Hobby plan: services sleep after idle. Upgrade to Pro ($20/mo) or set min replicas to 1. |
| "Application failed to respond" | The container is listening on a different port than Railway is routing to. Check you haven't set a `PORT` variable by hand — leave it to Railway. |
| Custom domain stuck "Pending" | DNS hasn't propagated. Run `dig +short www.yourdomain.com` — should return the Railway CNAME. |

## 🎁 Pro tips

1. **Use Railway's CLI for log tailing**: `npm i -g @railway/cli` → `railway logs --service backend` → live tail.
2. **Environment groups**: Railway lets you share variables across services. Add a shared group called "shared-secrets" so you only set `EMERGENT_LLM_KEY` once.
3. **Preview environments**: Settings → Environments → create `staging`. Every Pull Request gets its own URL automatically.
4. **Backup**: Mongo service → Settings → enable **automated backups** ($1/month).
5. **Monitor**: Built-in **Metrics** tab shows CPU, memory, request rate — no extra setup.

## 🆚 Quick decision tree

```
Is this your first deployment ever?
├── YES  → Use Railway (this guide). Visual, easy.
└── NO   → Want to save money long-term?
          ├── YES → Use Fly.io (/app/Fly.io Setup.md)
          └── NO  → Stick with Railway. It just works.
```

You're done. 🎉
