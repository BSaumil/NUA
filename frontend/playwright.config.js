/**
 * Golden-path smoke suite — not a full regression pack. The goal is a fast
 * "did we break the thing a real shift depends on" signal: log in, ring up
 * a sale, take payment; a guest places an order and can track it.
 *
 * Runs against the app's own production build, served statically, talking
 * to scripts/run_e2e_server.py — the real FastAPI app backed by mongomock
 * (in-memory), the same swap tests/inprocess/conftest.py uses. That means
 * CI needs no database service container: `npx playwright test` here boots
 * both halves of the stack itself via `webServer` below.
