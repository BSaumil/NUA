# Ananta POS - Windows Executable Build Instructions

## Complete Guide to Build Standalone Windows .exe

This guide will help you build a complete Windows installer that includes:
- ✅ Ananta POS Frontend (React)
- ✅ Ananta POS Backend (FastAPI)
- ✅ MongoDB Database
- ✅ Node.js Runtime (bundled by Electron)
- ✅ Python Runtime (bundled by PyInstaller)

---

## Prerequisites

You need to install the following on your Windows machine:

### 1. Node.js (includes npm)
- Download from: https://nodejs.org/
- Version: 18.x or higher (LTS recommended)
- Verify installation: `node --version` and `npm --version`

### 2. Python
- Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Version: 3.9 or higher
- ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- Verify installation: `python --version`

### 3. Git (to download the code)
- Download from: https://git-scm.com/
- Verify installation: `git --version`

### 4. Windows Build Tools
- Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
```powershell
npm install --global windows-build-tools
```

---

## Step-by-Step Build Process

### Step 1: Download MongoDB Portable

1. Download MongoDB Community Server (Windows, ZIP format):
   - URL: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
   - Select: Windows x64, ZIP
   - Version: 6.0 or higher

2. Extract the ZIP file

3. Create a folder structure:
   ```
   /app/mongodb/
   └── bin/
       ├── mongod.exe
       ├── mongo.exe
       └── (other MongoDB files)
   ```

4. Copy all files from the extracted `bin` folder to `/app/mongodb/bin/`

---

### Step 2: Build the Backend Executable

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell

2. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd /app/backend
```

3. Install PyInstaller:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

4. Install all backend dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the build script:
```bash
python build_backend.py
```

6. Verify the build:
   - Check that `/app/backend/dist/server.exe` exists
   - The file should be around 50-100 MB

**Troubleshooting Backend Build:**
- If you get "pyinstaller not found": Run `pip install pyinstaller` again
- If you get module import errors: Make sure all dependencies are installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- If build fails: Check the error messages and ensure Python is in your PATH

---

### Step 3: Build the Frontend and Create Installer

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd /app/frontend
```

2. Install Yarn (if not already installed):
```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

3. Copy the Electron package configuration:
```bash
copy electron-package.json package.json
```

4. Install all dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```

5. Install additional Electron dependencies:
```bash
yarn add electron-is-dev
```

6. Build the React app:
```bash
yarn build
```

7. Build the Electron installer:
```bash
yarn electron:build
```
   OR for portable version:
```bash
yarn build:portable
```

8. The installer will be created in `/app/frontend/dist/`:
   - **Installer**: `Ananta POS-Setup-2.0.1.exe` (NSIS installer)
   - **Portable**: `Ananta POS-Portable-2.0.1.exe` (No installation needed)

**Troubleshooting Frontend Build:**
- If `yarn install` fails: Delete `node_modules` folder and try again
- If build takes too long: Be patient, Electron builds can take 5-10 minutes
- If you get "EPERM" or permission errors: Run Command Prompt as Administrator
- If you get "electron-builder" errors: Make sure you have internet connection (downloads additional tools)

---

## Step 4: Test the Executable

### Testing the Installer:
1. Navigate to `/app/frontend/dist/`
2. Double-click `Ananta POS-Setup-2.0.1.exe`
3. Follow the installation wizard
4. Launch Ananta POS from the Start Menu or Desktop shortcut

### Testing the Portable Version:
1. Navigate to `/app/frontend/dist/`
2. Double-click `Ananta POS-Portable-2.0.1.exe`
3. The app should start directly (no installation)

### What to Expect:
- First launch may take 10-15 seconds (MongoDB and backend starting)
- A window should open showing the Ananta POS interface
- The app should work completely offline
- All features should be functional

---

## Build Output

After successful build, you will have:

```
/app/frontend/dist/
├── Ananta POS-Setup-2.0.1.exe          (Full installer, ~200-300 MB)
├── Ananta POS-Portable-2.0.1.exe       (Portable version, ~200-300 MB)
└── win-unpacked/                        (Unpacked app files)
```

---

## Distribution

You can distribute either:
- **Installer (.exe with Setup)**: Users run it and install like any Windows app
- **Portable (.exe Portable)**: Users can run directly from USB or any folder

Both versions include:
- ✅ Complete POS system
- ✅ No additional software needed
- ✅ Works completely offline
- ✅ Self-contained database

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Python not found"
**Solution**: 
- Reinstall Python and check "Add to PATH"
- Or manually add Python to PATH in Environment Variables

### Issue: "Node not found"
**Solution**:
- Reinstall Node.js
- Restart Command Prompt/PowerShell after installation

### Issue: Backend build fails with "No module named X"
**Solution**:
```bash
cd /app/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue: Electron build fails with "Cannot find module"
**Solution**:
```bash
cd /app/frontend
rm -rf node_modules
yarn install
```

### Issue: "Access denied" or "EPERM" errors
**Solution**:
- Run Command Prompt as Administrator
- Disable antivirus temporarily during build
- Check if files are open in another program

### Issue: Built app doesn't start
**Solution**:
- Check Windows Firewall (may block MongoDB port)
- Run the portable version first to test
- Check logs in `%APPDATA%/Ananta POS/logs/`

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Changing App Version
Edit `/app/frontend/electron-package.json`:
```json
"version": "2.0.1"  // Change this
```

### Customizing Installer
Edit the `nsis` section in `/app/frontend/electron-package.json`:
- Change installer text
- Add custom license
- Modify installation directory

### App Icon
Replace `/app/frontend/assets/icon.ico` with your custom 256x256 icon.
